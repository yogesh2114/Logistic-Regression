A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables. For example, a logistic regression could be used to predict whether a political candidate will win or lose an election or whether a high school student will be admitted or not to a particular college. These binary outcomes allow straightforward decisions between two alternatives.
